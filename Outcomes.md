# Outcomes
### What can be with radical collaboration?

Listing and writing down Colab's framework outcomes for communicating and sharing a better understanding of what can be with radical collaboration.

```
What's important to keep in mind?
- Write a title and a description to all of them
- Clear and direct language
- Think of value, why is it valueable? To whom? Is it clear what do you get from it? Do you want it?
- Is care there? How is it showing (context/words)?
```
